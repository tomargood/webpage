        <div class="container p-3">
            <p>This project was built to accomplish two primary goals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn Python, web scraping and API interations</li>
                <li>Create a personal tool utalizing basic modern building blocks which I could improve upon over time
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The application and surrounding website is a Flask-based web program featuring several static pages and
                one dynamic tool:
                an aviation weather checker. This project serves as a personal portfolio to document my journey in
                learning technology, with the aviation weather tool being the final project of my latest harvard python
                course.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout development, I gained foundational knowledge in the below technologies</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Flask</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>git</li>
                <li>Cloud Computing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>
                The main tool above allows users to input an airport identifier and receive real-time weather data built
                for pilots. The results are color-coded based on FAA flight conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green</strong>: VFR (Visual Flight Rules). Safe for visual flying.</li>
                <li><strong>Red</strong>: IFR (Instrument Flight Rules). Low ceilings or poor visibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue</strong>: Marginal VFR, not quite IFR, but not good enough for VFR either.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Intelligent Ceiling Detection</h3>
            <p>
                Not all low clouds constitute a "ceiling." The program intelligently determines when conditions truly
                impact flight safety by filtering out scattered or few clouds that donâ€™t restrict visual navigation.
                Broken or overcast layers do, however, restrict visual flying.
            </p>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The design and decisions behind this tool were focused on usability for aircrew members needing a
                quick weather reference when planning flights. Additionally I wanted to begin learning the basics of
                deploying a production website.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>Planned features and additions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to check multiple airports at once</li>
                <li>Validation of airport codes and intelligent suggestions on better weather around the location</li>
                <li>Searching for nearby alternate airports based on radius</li>
                <li>Adding in form control</li>
                <li>deploying and linking a database for CRUD operations</li>
            </ul>
