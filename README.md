# Aviation Weather Tool (Flask Project)
This project was built to accomplish two primary goals:
1. Learn Python and web scraping
2. Create a useful, personal tool I could use and improve over time

## Overview
2
The application is a Flask-based web program featuring several static pages and one dynamic tool: an aviation weather checker. This project serves as a personal portfolio to document my journey in learning technology, with the aviation weather tool being the centerpiece of this particular project and this course.

Throughout development, I gained foundational knowledge in:

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS

## Features

The main tool allows users to input an airport identifier and receive real-time weather data built for pilots. The results are color-coded based on FAA flight conditions:

- **Green**: VFR (Visual Flight Rules). Safe for visual flying.
- **Red**: IFR (Instrument Flight Rules). Low ceilings or poor visibility.
- **Blue**: Marginal VFR, not quite IFR, but not good enough for VFR either.

### Intelligent Ceiling Detection

Not all low clouds constitute a "ceiling." The program intelligently determines when conditions truly impact flight safety by filtering out scattered or few clouds that donâ€™t restrict visual navigation.  Broken or Overcast layers, do, however restrict visual flying

## Purpose

The design and decisions behind this tool were focused on usability for aircrew members needing a quick weather reference when planning flights.

## Future Improvements

Planned features include:

- Ability to check multiple airports at once
- Validation of airport codes and inteligent suggestions on better weather around the location
- Searching for nearby alternate airports based on radius
